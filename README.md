My first portfolio created from scratch using Bootstrap CSS framework.
3 diffrent pages were created, index page, portfolio page, and contact page.
Each page has a nav bar with a responsive layout, responsive images and footer with links to social account.
Semantic HTML was used for each page.
Pages utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
